### Make your own theme!!

Use the format of this repo to make your own devtools theme, just make a `styles.css` that is actually awesome. You can also port any of the [righteous themes at devthemez.com](http://devthemez.com/themes/chrome-developer-tools?sort=popular) to this new format. Or ask their maintainers to. 

You can also use Yeoman to easily create new themes: https://github.com/zenorocha/generator-devtools-theme

Then publish to the web store. Please add ["devtools theme"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search-extensions/devtools%20theme) to the name so people can easily find them!

Additionally, I would recommend looking at what's happening at [zero-base-themes](https://github.com/mauricecruz/zero-base-themes), which is creating a platform for DevTools theming. Looks great!
